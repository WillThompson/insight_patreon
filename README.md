# Patreon Pro
## Recommendations for content creators!

In this repository, you will find the underlying code for my project, *Patreon Pro*. It is an application created for content creators fundraising on Patreon.com to compare the content of their patreon page to other working in similar content spaces (i.e. podcasting, visual arts, even software!). Essentially, the app will scan and analyze the summary of a creator's campaign to characterize its content. It will then compare to a large sample of other patreon campaigns, find those that are 'most similar' in terms of content, determine which factors are significant in terms of soliciting funding, and display recommendations to the user.

The live version of the project is located at: [http://www.patreonpro.site:5000](http://www.patreonpro.site:5000)
